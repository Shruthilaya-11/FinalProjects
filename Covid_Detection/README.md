# CovidDetection
Rapid and accurate diagnosis of COVID-19 is crucial for improving patient outcomes and reducing the burden on healthcare systems. This project focuses on building a deep learning-based multi-class image classification model that can distinguish between:  COVID-19  Viral Pneumonia  Normal chest X-ray images

Key Highlights
Preprocessing: Image augmentation, resizing, normalization
Modeling: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with Transfer Learning (e.g., ResNet, VGG, DenseNet)
Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC, Confusion Matrix
Deployment: Streamlit-based web app for real-time image classification

Skills Demonstrated:
Medical Image Preprocessing & Augmentation
Deep Learning & Transfer Learning
Multi-class Image Classification
Model Evaluation & Fine-Tuning
End-to-End Deployment Workflow
